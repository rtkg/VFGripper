\section{Conclusion}
There are plenty of methods to control a DC motor. In this report a couple of them were treated. 

Working with the environment requires interaction so taking into consideration more than one variable is necessary. The most obvious conclusion is that the more complicated type of control, the more effort is needed to achieve the goal. It is why all the basic methods always worked fast and reliable, and the more complex did not. The problem is achieving two different goals which is practically impossible. All things considered make more complex methods more difficult to implement, however, if properly done, they are the best choice. The point is to find a fair trade-off between goals that should be achieved. 

Furthermore, working with hardware might be a source of difficult to track down problems. Due to working with not impeccable measuring equipment, filtering variables, i.e. current and position, is really important. A PID controller plays a crucial role in control. If properly tuned, the controller is fast and precise. 

Future research efforts will be devoted to improving all types of control.
