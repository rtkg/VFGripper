\section{Introduction}
The report treats of effects of my internship that took place at \textit{School of Science and Technology} at the \textit{Ã–rebro University} in Sweden. I worked for \textit{Centre for Applied Autonomous Sensor Systems}, at the \textit{Mobile Robotics and Olfaction Lab}. A time span I spent here was two months, namely August and September 2015. My main goal was to test different ways of control \textsf{The Velvet Fingers}. Since the gripper is a smart gripper using a novel concept of the end-effector combining simple under-actuated mechanics with high manipulation possibilities, there is only need to control DC motors.
